## String enums

Sometimes you need a collection of strings collected under a common key. Prior to TypeScript 2.4, TypeScript only supported number-based enums. If using versions prior to 2.4, a work-around is to use [string literal types to create string based enums by combining with union types](../types/literal-types.md).
